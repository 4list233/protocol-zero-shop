# Cart Page Implementation - Complete

## What Was Changed

### 1. Created Dedicated Cart Page
**File:** `/app/cart/page.tsx`

A full-page shopping cart experience with:
- **Large, visible cart items** - Each item displayed in a spacious card with 128x128px images
- **Full item details** - Product title, variant, price, and image clearly shown
- **Quantity controls** - Easy +/- buttons to adjust quantities
- **Remove items** - X button to delete items from cart
- **Order summary sidebar** - Sticky sidebar showing total, shipping info, and checkout button
- **Responsive layout** - 2-column grid on desktop (items + summary), single column on mobile
- **Empty state** - Friendly message with "Browse Products" button when cart is empty

### 2. Simplified Cart Drawer Component
**File:** `/components/cart-drawer.tsx`

Converted the cart drawer from a complex slide-out panel to a simple cart button:
- Shows shopping cart icon
- Displays item count badge
- Links directly to `/cart` page
- Automatically updates count when items are added/removed

### 3. Updated Cart Functions
**File:** `/lib/cart.ts`

Added event dispatching to cart functions:
- `saveCart()` now dispatches `cartUpdated` event
- `clearCart()` now dispatches `cartUpdated` event
- This allows all components to listen and update automatically

### 4. Updated Shop Page
**File:** `/app/shop/page.tsx`

- Removed complex cart state management
- Simplified to just use the CartDrawer button
- Toast notification now links to `/cart` instead of `/checkout`

## How It Works

1. **Adding Items:**
   - Click "Add to Cart" on any product in `/shop`
   - Toast notification appears confirming item was added
   - Cart button badge updates with new item count
   - Click "View Cart" in toast or cart button to go to `/cart`

2. **Cart Page (`/cart`):**
   - See all items in large, clearly visible cards
   - Each item shows: image, title, variant, unit price, quantity controls, subtotal
   - Adjust quantities with +/- buttons
   - Remove items with X button
   - Order summary shows: subtotal, item count, total
   - "Proceed to Checkout" button goes to `/checkout`
   - "Continue Shopping" button returns to `/shop`

3. **Real-time Updates:**
   - Cart badge updates automatically when items are added/removed
   - Cart page listens for changes and updates in real-time
   - All components stay in sync via `cartUpdated` events

  â†‘                      â†“
  â””â”€â”€ Continue Shopping â”€â”˜
```

## Testing

1. Go to http://localhost:3000/shop
2. Add items to cart (you'll see toast notifications)
3. Click the cart icon in the header (shows item count badge)
4. You'll be taken to `/cart` where you can see all items clearly
