## 🚀 Next: Enable Instagram (Optional)

To enable Instagram sign-in:

1. In Firebase Console, go to **Sign-in method**
2. Click **Facebook** (Instagram uses Facebook Auth)
3. Toggle **Enable**
4. You'll need to create a Facebook App:
   - Go to https://developers.facebook.com/

## 📊 Firebase Console Features

In your Firebase Console you can:

- View authentication activity
- Disable/delete users
- See sign-in methods used
- Export user data
- Set up email verification
- Configure password requirements

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Unauthorized domain" error
- The domain is already authorized in Firebase
- If you get this on deployment, add your production domain

### "Popup blocked" error
- Allow popups for localhost in browser
- Or change to redirect mode instead

### Auth not persisting
- Check browser cookies are enabled
- Clear cache and try again

### Can't see sign-in button
- Make sure dev server is running
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify .env.local is loaded

## ✨ What's Next?

After authentication works:
1. Test the sign-in flow
2. Test the account page
3. Try signing out and back in
4. Add more user profile features
5. Connect auth to your Prisma database (optional)
6. Build the social features (clips, calendar, etc.)
